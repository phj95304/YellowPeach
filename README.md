# YellowPeach IoT Dashboard

YellowPeach is a project that allows easy and fast creation of dashboard applications and virtual IoT devices.

## Project Overview

Every IoT system requires a dashboard application to monitor the status of IoT sensors or devices in the form of charts or graphs. This project provides a system called YellowPeach to easily create such applications.

## Key Features

- **Dashboard Application Creation**: YellowPeach includes an authoring tool that allows the quick and easy creation of dashboard applications through a menu-based approach.
- **Virtual IoT Device Emulation**: YellowPeach provides the ability to emulate virtual IoT devices for scenarios where a real IoT system is not available.
- **Portable Server**: The YellowPeach server is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 to enhance portability.
- **Various Components**: The server includes MQTT broker, database, viewer program, and virtual IoT device emulator.
- **Web Viewer Program**: Developed a viewer program accessible from any web browser for user convenience.

## System Configuration

The YellowPeach system consists of the following components:

- **Dashboard Authoring Tool**: A tool for quickly creating dashboard applications.
- **Virtual IoT Device Emulator**: An emulator for generating virtual sensor values when a real IoT system is not present.
- **Raspberry Pi 3 Server**: A portable server with all the components of the system.

## Test IoT Application System

The test IoT application system developed to validate the overall operation of YellowPeach is implemented with two systems: a smart farm and a smart home.
